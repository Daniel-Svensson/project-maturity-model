Instructions:
Thanks for taking the time to participate in this discussion and help us build this program in the open. Please delete the
below when creating a new issue. 
1. In an effort to keep things as focused and productive as possible, please avoid creating new issues focused on general 
discussion or including a list of issues. Instead, please jump in on some of the existing discussion issues:
  * [#14 Concerns with the Project Maturity Model](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/project-maturity-model/issues/14)
  * [#9 Feedback on the proposed model](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/project-maturity-model/issues/9)
2. Please open new issues to track specific issues. A good issue should have a single, clear, achievable deliverable. What
are the conditions under which your issue can be closed? If there aren't clear conditions for closing the issue, it might
be an open ended discussion... see 1. above. If you have a list of suggestions, please open several issues.
3. Feel free to open pull requests with suggested changes to the policies we've proposed.
