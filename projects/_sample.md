# Tardis Project

The [Tardis project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) provides a set of tools and libraries that enable the user to travel through space and time. This capability is particularly useful for cases where people have made mistakes in the past (or the future) and want to fix them.

Tardis software components are only effective if they are properly installed in some form of British-made computer in a big blue police box. It is also very helpful if the user is wearing colorful stripes, on some part of their clothing (for example, scarf or shirt).

## Trusted Successors
